The goal of this project is to provide a method of configuring networking on generic Linux systems using the Sysrepo NETCONF server implementation. 

## About this component

This repository contains several Sysrepo plugins related to newtork management.

The first, sysrepo-plugin-interfaces is based on the `ietf-interfaces` YANG module which contains
"a collection of YANG definitions for managing network interfaces".
More information about the specific YANG module can be found in
[RFC 7223: A YANG Data Model for Interface Management](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7223).

The second, sysrepo-plugin-routing is based on the `ietf-routing` YANG module which contains
"generic components of a routing data model" and `ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing` and `ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing`
which augment `ietf-routing` with IPv4 and IPv6 specific data.
More information about `ietf-routing` is available in [RFC 8022: A YANG Data Model for Routing Management](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8022)

## Development

Besides the usual C development environment, the following additional dependencies are required:

* libyang
* sysrepo
* pthreads
* netlink

#### Build

First clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/telekom/sysrepo-plugin-interfaces
```

Next, create a build directory and generate the build recipes using CMake:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
```

By default both plugins will be built, but either of them can be disabled by setting the appropriate CMake plugin option to `OFF`.
For example, to build only the routing plugin the following command should be executed instead:
```
$ cmake -DINTERFACES_PLUGIN=OFF ..
```

The default configuration builds the plugins as stand-alone foreground applications.
To build the plugins as shared object files for use with `sysrepo-plugind`, run the following instead:

```
$ cmake -DPLUGIN=ON ..
```

Lastly, invoke the build and install using `make`:

```
$ make -j$(nproc) install
```

The plugins require several YANG modules to be loaded into the Sysrepo datastore.
For the interfaces plugin this can be achieved by invoking the following commands:

```
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-interfaces@2018-02-20.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/iana-if-type@2017-01-19.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-ip@2018-02-22.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-if-extensions@2020-07-29.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ieee802-dot1q-types.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-if-vlan-encapsulation@2020-07-13.yang
```

For the routing plugin, the following models have to be installed:
```
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-interfaces@2018-02-20.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/iana-if-type@2017-01-19.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-ip@2018-02-22.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-routing@2018-03-13.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing@2018-03-13.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing@2018-03-13.yang
$ sysrepoctl -i ./yang/ietf-ipv4-router-advertisements@2018-03-13.yang
```
